        Well, I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
        through some interesting places on the way:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
            <li>Last chance, CO</li>
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
        </ol>

            Well, I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        </p>
            <blockquote>
            Passing cars, <br>
            when you can't see,<br> 
            May get you,<br>
            A glimpse, <br>
            of enternity.<br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I wasn't definitely passing any cars.
        </p>

        <p>
            My first day of the trip!
            I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
            I only brought these items with me:
            </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Cell phone</li>
            <li>Digital Camera</li>
            <li>Protein Bar</li>
        </ul> 
            
        <p>
            Just the essenstials. 
            As Lao Tzu would say: <q>A journey of thousand miles begin with one Segway</q>
